# Property Viewer – Java GUI Application with Real Estate Dataset

**Developer:** Ayan Shaikh  
**Language:** Java (BlueJ)  
**Project Type:** Object-Oriented GUI Application  
**Built for:** Coursework project at King’s College London

## Project Overview

Property Viewer is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a real-world property listing platform using real data from Airbnb London. This project emphasizes object-oriented programming, GUI development, and data file handling.

It was designed to help users navigate, explore, and filter a portfolio of property listings. The system demonstrates real-time interaction between a visual interface and a structured backend system using clean OOP principles.

## Key Features

- **Java Swing GUI:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring property data.
- **Real Dataset:** Loads and displays data from `airbnb-london.csv`, simulating real-world application use.
- **Property Filtering:** Users can browse listings by price range, availability, or property features.
- **MVC Pattern:** Clean code separation between data (`Property.java`), logic (`Portfolio.java`, `PropertyViewer.java`), and interface (`PropertyViewerGUI.java`).

## File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Property.java` | Blueprint for individual Airbnb properties |
| `Portfolio.java` | Manages a collection of Property objects |
| `PropertyViewer.java` | Handles business logic and interactions |
| `PropertyViewerGUI.java` | Builds the graphical user interface |
| `airbnb-london.csv` | CSV dataset containing real Airbnb listings |

## Skills Demonstrated

- Java Swing UI Development  
- File I/O and CSV parsing  
- Data filtering and aggregation  
- Object-Oriented Design and MVC Architecture  
- Application structure for real-world simulation

## How to Run

1. Open in BlueJ  
2. Load the CSV file into the application  
3. Launch the GUI via `PropertyViewerGUI.java`  
4. Use provided tools to explore, filter, and view properties
