# Ayan Shaikh â€“ AI & Programming Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of programming and AI-related projects, submitted as part of my application to the Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence at MBZUAI.

This repository showcases two coursework projects developed during my AI studies at Kingâ€™s College London, highlighting my experience in object-oriented programming, game logic, user interface design, and working with real-world datasets.

## ðŸ”¹ [The Square â€“ AI-Driven Java Strategy Game](./TheSquare)

A turn-based grid game developed in Java using object-oriented principles, where two AI-controlled robots (Rook and Bishop) interact with the player based on programmed logic.

**Key Features:**
- Full object-oriented design with 12+ custom classes
- Game state rendered via ASCII map
- AI agents simulate pathfinding, threat detection, and player interaction
- Includes game logic for inventory, movement, and door control

**Tech stack:** Java (BlueJ), ASCII rendering, rule-based AI logic
